Of course, [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/) was a main resource, and while I have eight tabs open to his site as I write this, his page [detailing UI Architectures](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html) served as the foundation that I built this on

[Jesse Warden](http://jessewarden.com/)'s intro on his [article describing Backbone for Flex devs](http://jessewarden.com/2012/08/backbone-js-for-flash-and-flex-developers.html) was my Eureka! moment.

[Jeremy Miller](http://jeremydmiller.com/) spent time going through these [patterns for WinForms](http://codebetter.com/jeremymiller/2007/07/26/the-build-your-own-cab-series-table-of-contents/). 

[Steven Sanderson] wrote a great comparison of [seven popular JavaScript Frameworks](http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2012/08/01/rich-javascript-applications-the-seven-frameworks-throne-of-js-2012/).
